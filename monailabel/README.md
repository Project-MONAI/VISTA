## Overview

MONAI VISTA is a plaform solution of deploying medical segmentation foundation models. This section
 provides a MONAI Label integration of APIs and samples apps. The integration is a server-client 
 system that facilitates interactive medical image segmentation using AI models such as segment 
 anything medical model (SAMM) or other prompt-based annotation algorithms. 

MONAI VISTA - MONAI Label integration is an intelligent opem source ecosystem that embables users
to create and deploy vision foundation models especially for medical segmenation. It provides 
interfaces of class- and point-prompts that AI models can take as input. The integration also provides
sample 3D Slicer plugin UIs.

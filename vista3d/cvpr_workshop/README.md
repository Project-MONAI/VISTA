# Overview
This repository is written for the "CVPR 2025: Foundation Models for Interactive 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation"([link](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/5263/)) challenge. It 
is based on MONAI 1.4. Many of the functions in the main VISTA3D repository are moved to MONAI 1.4 and this simplified folder will directly use components from MONAI.


It is simplified to train interactive segmentation models across different modalities. The sophisticated transforms and recipes used for VISTA3D are removed. The finetuned VISTA3D checkpoint on the challenge subsets is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r2KvHP_30nHR3LU7NJEdscVnlZ2hTtcd/view?usp=sharing)

# Setup
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Training
Download the challenge subsets finetuned [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r2KvHP_30nHR3LU7NJEdscVnlZ2hTtcd/view?usp=sharing) or VISTA3D original [checkpoint]((https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DRYA2-AI-UJ23W1VbjqHsnHENGi0ShUl/view?usp=sharing)). Generate a json list that contains your traning data and update the json file path in the script.
```
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 train_cvpr.py
```

# Inference
You can directly download the [docker file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r2KvHP_30nHR3LU7NJEdscVnlZ2hTtcd/view?usp=sharing) for the challenge baseline.
We provide a Dockerfile to satisfy the challenge format. For more details, refer to the [challenge website]((https://www.codabench.org/competitions/5263/)).
```
docker build -t vista3d:latest .
docker save -o vista3d.tar.gz vista3d:latest
```
